# Car_Price_Prediction

In the automobile market, the determination of car prices involves a complex interplay between sellers and buyers.
Sellers, driven by factors such as production costs, market demand, and competition, strategically set the initial price for their vehicles. 
On the other hand, buyers evaluate various aspects, including the car's brand reputation, features, condition, and personal budget, to determine the perceived value of the vehicle.

According to the results of the analysis, most of the cars in these data were produced between 2010 and 2020, with three manufacturing companies including Hyundai, Toyota and Maes-Bens.
the largest category of production is sedan, with a price as high as $150,000. The average car still uses gasoline as its fuel. For safety features such as airbags, the average car already has 4 / 12 airbags.
Cars with turbochargers and leather interiors tend to have higher price than cars without these two features.

As for the model here, it is still underfit, so in the future improvement is to use more parameters for hyperparameter adjustment, or through repeated functional engineering, hoping to improve the performance model.
